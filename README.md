This is my implementation of a Lox interpreter from the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book based on the [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) challenge. In order to not step on their toes, I removed all the codecrafters plumbing )a build.clj file, and a bunch of yaml files). 

The challenge is done on their git servers, so this github repo will have code that I move over from time to time up until I'm completely done with the challenge at which point I'll turn this repo into the source of truth and put work into the build process and unit tests. Please note that the codecrafters CLI tool runs a bunch of tests on my code for each step to ensure that it is right, so this code has been tested just not with unit tests...yet.
